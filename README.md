# StarsandStripesVentures
To further expand all areas of the blockchain by serving the public. I'm a registered business owner and want to help nurture technology into the new age by aligning my vision with the provision to achieve harmonious results. Being a military veteran I also have the leadership skills to lead this team to victory. Much has already been invested in my idea personally. I'm grateful to be here and to help. My vision is of me continuing my journey to build a chain of businesses that coorelate with the tech era while advancing into the financial sector  as well. Tokens, bots and exchanges are all easily made these days. As a whole I see a ton of opportunity to expand blockchain into the public. Also I love door to door sales and I have a few tricks up my sleeve to get the word out into areas not completely dominated by the internet.
